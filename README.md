I'm a Computational statistician turned data scientist/engineer who is passionate about using artificial
intelligence to make the world a slightly better place. Typically, I like to 
work on projects involving machine learning, nlp or 
any analyses involving human behavior. In my spare time, you will often
find me working on personal [projects]()  which typically reside on the intersection of AI and human behavior.
